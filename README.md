# The Ultimate Piano Playing Experience

Welcome to the *"How to Click Keys Like a Pro"* project! Here, we take the sophisticated art of piano playing and reduce it to a series of clicks and clacks. Because who needs years of practice, right?

## Features

- **Play Like a Master**: Click on keys that sound like music without actually knowing how to play! It's all about that *randomness*.
- **Select Your Notes**: Want to sound like a confused chicken? Just choose random notes! Who cares about melodies?
- **Selenium Magic**: Watch in awe as our code opens a web browser and makes it dance to our commands. It’s basically a digital puppet show.
- **Dynamic Delays**: Want to click faster? Want to click slower? We've got the *power* to change the speed! It’s like controlling a sloth or a cheetah.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository. Or don’t. I mean, who really cares?
2. Make sure you have Python installed. If you don’t, just stare at your screen and pretend to know what you’re doing.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If that doesn’t work, try turning it off and on again.
4. Execute the main script. Marvel at the magical sounds of your keyboard clicking.

## Usage

Just modify the `notes_to_play` list and watch as your computer does all the work. If you hear music, you did something right. If not, well, better luck next time!

## Contributing

Feel free to submit *your* best practices on how to completely miss the point of music. We're all about encouraging chaotic creativity here.

## Disclaimer

This project will not make you a better musician. In fact, it might do the opposite. Use at your own risk! Enjoy the absurdity!
